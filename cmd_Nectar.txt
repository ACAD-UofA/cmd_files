#### Build a Virtual Machine (VM) on the Nectar Cloud
http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/overview.html

### Check or generate your SSH key
## this key is unique to your computer and is used as identification between your machine and the VM
## instructions as per (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

# Check if you already have a SSH key:
# In terminal
cd ~/.ssh

# if "No such file or directory" you need to generate a key (if you have the directory, go to the step #@@@#):
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
ssh-add id_rsa
# enter a 'paraphrase' (easy password you will still remember in 6 months!)

#@@@# copy your SSH key (same than going to ~/.ssh/ and copy the content of 'id_rsa.pub')
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


### Logon the Nectar cloud dashboard to instantiate your VM
# Go to https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/
# login with you Uni details
# go to 'Images and Snapshots' then 'Nectar official' (top right panel) - or Public if you are after a specific type of VM
# Select an image (here we are using the latest ubuntu version "NeCTAR Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy) amd64 UEC") by clicking on 'Launch'
# Give a name
# Choose between small and medium 'flavor' (if you don't have further allocation)
# In 'Access and Security' tick "ssh" and paste your ssh key with your computer name in 'Keypair'
# Don't care about the rest, just launch


### Connect to your VM
# in 'instances' (left panel), copy the IP address once the VM is 'Active' (e.g., 130.220.208.191)
# in terminal, ssh (connect) to your VM
ssh ubuntu@130.220.208.191

# You're done!!!


### Run BEAST on your VM
# Install Java
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

# The /mnt disk has a larger capacity than the /home/ubuntu, you may prefer to use /mnt for data storage
# Edit permissions of /mnt
sudo chmod 777 /mnt
# Ignore the error message sudo: unable to resolve host

# Copy all necessary input files (i.e., beast jar executable, input files...)
# From a separate terminal tab (not connected to the VM):
scp -r /Users/julien/MyBeastFolder ubuntu@130.220.208.191:MyBeastFolder/

# Run BEAST
cd MyBeastFolder
nohup java -Xmx4g -jar ./beast_1_7_5.jar -threads 3 Mitochondrial_cal2_6clocks_allTaxa_3.xml &
nohup java -Xmx4g -jar ./beast_1_7_5.jar -threads 3 Mitochondrial_cal2_6clocks_noCrocs_3.xml &
nohup java -Xmx4g -jar ./beast_1_7_5.jar -threads 3 Mitochondrial_cal2_6clocks_noTinamous_noCrocs_3.xml &
nohup java -Xmx4g -jar ./beast_1_7_5.jar -threads 3 Mitochondrial_cal2_6clocks_noTinamous_3.xml &

# Copy output files back to your computer
# From a separate terminal tab (not connected to the VM):
scp -r ubuntu@130.220.208.191:MyBeastFolder /Users/julien/MyBeastFolder/
